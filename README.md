A silly simple data storage engine. 

### Goals

- Prototype and experiment with data storage and retrieval techniques/patterns/structures.
- Demonstrate automated unit-testing and continuous integration.

### Nuget

At some point I may make this library available as a nuget, but for now please take/copy/fork the source to your hearts content.
